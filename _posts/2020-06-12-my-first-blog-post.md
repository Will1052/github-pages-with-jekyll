  I have been playing soccer since I was 4. Now I have been on the township team for about seven years. I find the the sport to be extremely fun and liberating.

  I have been playing the violin since fourth grade in school. I still take Orchestra today. It is nice to be part of an ensemble with my friends.

  I have volunteered in many places over the past two years, including Playhouse 22, Heavenly Farms and multiple East Brunswick events
